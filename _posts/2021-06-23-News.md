title: "Alexandre Colle Delivers Design Informatics Webinar on Aesthetics and Robotics"
---

CARE Group student <a href="https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/students/alexandre-colle">Alexandre Colle</a> has delivered a talk on 'Aesthetics and Robotics' as part of the Design Informatics Webinar series.

The abstract from the talk is below:

*"Social robotics has become a multidisciplinary endeavour, from human psychology to material engineering and to some extend molecular biology. A social robot is also a product. Accordingly it needs to exist as part of a larger narrative, embodied by aesthetics.*

*Design exists for aesthetics. Robotics ignores it.*

*In this talk I will present my research on how to better integrate aesthetics principles in robotics and its consequences for the industry and designers alike."*

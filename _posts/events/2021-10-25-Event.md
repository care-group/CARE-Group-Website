This webinar will take place on 12:00 BST on 25 October 2021, presented on behalf of the Institution of Mechanical Engineering (IMechE), Mechatronics, Informatics and Control Group. Register for the event [here](https://events.imeche.org/ViewEvent?e=7424).

## Abstract
"Robots and autonomous systems have the potential to revolutionise the future provision of health and social care. In this talk Dr. Mauro Dragone will discuss both the potential for, and also the obstacles and concerns that still hinder, the take-up and use of assistive robotic technology.

He will provide an overview of relevant research activities, with a focus of EU and UK projects, and illustrate the facilities and the services provided by the UK National Robotarium at Heriot-Watt University. The overarching goal of these activities is the development of user-friendly independent living systems combining Internet of Things (IoT) and Robotic technology working together to assist humans, triage issues and facilitate communication and connectivity as part of personalised and connected health and social care practices.

Mauroâ€™s presentation will be followed by an interactive question and answer session, allowing audience members to put their queries forward."

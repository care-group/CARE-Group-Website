title: "Robotics + Care Mashup 2023 (16th - 20th October)"
---

Organised by the <a href="https://care.hw.ac.uk">CARE Group</a> from the <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/research/the-national-robotarium.htm">National Robotarium, Heriot-Watt University</a>, the Robotics + Care Mashup will return in October 2023 to bring together end-users, academics, care providers and technologists to develop solutions that could help people live more independent lives. The event will feature lectures and talks from leading experts in healthcare, assistive technology and robotics - all centered around a 5 days long hackathon.


Get immersed in a real product development process over the course of a week, with delegates from all around the country. Explore the use of emerging technology including cloud, robotics and the Internet of Things equipped with machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.

These can be used to enable non-intrusive monitoring of behaviour and vital signs, detect patterns and trends in behaviour and individual health status, identify problems, support self-management, decision-making and risk assessment, triage issues, facilitate communication and social connectedness, and provide social, cognitive and physical assistance when needed

Whether your goal is to learn about robotic innovation for the care sector, develop your skills, solve a specific challenge, find a future collaborator, or simply meet like minded people - please get on board!

Anyone is free to join the community, attend talks, and follow the progress of the teams participating to the hackathon and give their feedback on the concepts being developed throughout the week.  

As in our <a href="https://www.scottishhousingnews.com/articles/robotics-and-care-event-demonstrates-world-first-for-assisted-living-technology-users">2021 edition</a>, we'll be hosting product development sessions and workshops from companies providing technical support, including APIs and sensor kits, as well as exploring topics such as ethics and cybersecurity.

People unable to travel or attend in person will be able to follow online sessions, and interact or even program our robots over the Internet through our <a href="http://care.hw.ac.uk/research/openaal.html">Open Ambient Assisted Living (OpenAAL) Laboratory!</a>

Dr. Mauro Dragone will present his talk 'Robotics in Assisted Living' at the <a href="https://www.nrtimes.co.uk/event/techcon-21-virtual-conference/">TechCon Virtual Conference presented by Cloisters</a>.

Read the abstract of the talk below:

"Robots and autonomous systems have the potential to revolutionise the future provision of health and social care. In this talk I will discuss the potential but also the obstacles and concerns that still hinder the take-up and use of assistive robotic technology. I will provide an overview of relevant research activities, with a focus of EU and UK projects, and illustrate the facilities and the services provided by the UK National Robotarium, Heriot-Watt University. The overarching goal of our activities is the development of user-friendly independent living systems combining Internet of Things (IoT) and Robotic technology working together to assist humans, triage issues and facilitate communication and connectivity as part of personalised and connected health and social care practices."

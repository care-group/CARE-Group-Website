One hour short visit from 8 students from Woodlands School, hosted by Dr. Samantha Clark and Dr. Mauro Dragone. The students programmed a set of Spheros robots in different tasks and also drive one of our telepresence robots, remotely, to make a virtual visit to our Robotic Assisted Living Testbed (RALT). 

Number of pupils directly working with the robots in one day: 8
Number of teachers interacting with the robots over both days: ~4

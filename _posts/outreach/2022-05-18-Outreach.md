A daylong conference held at Heriot-Watt University with teachers coming from around the Lothians to both learn about the latest research being done at the University and what type of outreach and engagement activities we could collaborate on. For this event Dr Alistair McConnell gave a presentation on the latest work being conducted in the areas of Computer Science in Heriot-Watt including work done in the different research groups, such as the Vale Group, CARE Group, Interactive and Trustworthy Technologies Group, LAIV: Lab for AI Verification and the Interaction Lab.

The teachers were then shown the different ways we have engaged with schools in the past and how we would like to do it going forward, they all got a shot at navigating the Robotic Assisted Living Testbed (RALT) using a telepresence robot and gave feedback on how engaging it would be for the pupils.

Number of teachers in attendance and navigating the lab: ~20

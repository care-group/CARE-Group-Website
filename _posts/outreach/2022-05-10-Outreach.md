title: "Class visit from St Cuthbert’s Primary School"
---

One hour short visit from 27 P7s (11 years old) students from St. Cuthbert’s’ Primary, hosted by Scott MacLeod, Dr. Samantha Clark and Dr Alistair McConnell. The students  programmed a set of Spheros robots in different tasks and also drive one of our telepresence robots, remotely. The latter provided the students with a way to “visit” one of our robotic laboratories: Students used a web-browser to control the movements of the telepresence robot while engaging in a video call to interact with the researchers there. They explored different rooms of our Robotic Assisted Living Testbed (RALT) and discovered some of the robots that are currently being developed for helping people in their home.

Number of pupils directly working with the robots in one day: 27
Number of teachers interacting with the robots over both days: ~ 4

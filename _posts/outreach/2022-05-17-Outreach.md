Two separate days of robotics inspired careers events, the pupils were given a short presentation of the career path of Dr. Alistair McConnell, followed by a chance to navigate around the Robotic Assisted Living Testbed using a telepresence robot: They could talk to the researchers working there and ask them questions about their work and how they got to where they are now. While this was going on, the pupils were split into two groups: Some of them wrote code for the Miro robots, programming them to avoid obstacles or to play football against each other.

In the afternoon, Matthew Oâ€™Hara demonstrated the Spot robot and explained its capabilities and research applications. He also spoke about his experience in our graduate apprenticeship degree.

Stats:
- Number of pupils directly working with the robots over both days: ~40
- Number who observed the Spot and asked questions: ~60

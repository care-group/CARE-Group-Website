---

CARE Group members Ronnie Smith, Scott MacLeod and Alexandre Colle attended the Scottish Care Home Conference &amp; Exhibition 2021 (postponed from last year) at the Hilton hotel in Glasgow, Scotland. They hosted one of several 'insight sessions' at the conference, on the role of technology and robotics in care. 

During the session, they presented the work of the CARE Group and the role of the [Robotic Assisted Living Testbed (RALT)](ralt.hw.ac.uk) around assistive robotic technology. This included introducing to the audience the modular robot Robobrico, and companion robot Maah.

The conference focuses on the significant role care home services play in ensuring individuals can remain connected to their communities and the criticality of their involvement in shaping Scotlandâ€™s future health and social care system.

On the 21st of November, CARE Group joined the [Digital Health and Care Fest](https://echalliance.com/event/digital-health-and-care-fest-2019/) at the Strathclyde Innovation and Technology Centre in Glasgow, to present their research to the public.

Members of the lab engaged with a very enthusiastic crowd, curious about the robots and their potential for healthcare.
From Pepperâ€™s important role in rehabilitation and companionship, to the playful and watchful Miro, the public remained adamant and very positive about the role of these devices. It was also an opportunity to present Maah, our new recruit, a social robot promoting sensory experience and comfort via a 3D knitted robe.
 
The festival was a great opportunity to grasp the dynamism and the thirst for innovation in healthcare. Both digital services and IoT were competing for attention, in an ever growing market.

---

Hosted by the the <a href="https://ralt.hw.ac.uk/openaal.html">Open Ambient Assisted Living (OpenAAL)</a> project, part of the <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/research/the-national-robotarium.htm">National Robotarium at Heriot-Watt University</a>, the Robotics + Care Mashup will bring together academics, care providers and technologists to develop solutions for assisted living.

Get immersed in a real product development process over the course of a week, with delegates from all around the country. Explore the use of emerging technology including cloud, robotics and the Internet of Things equipped with machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. You'll own everything you develop and set your own metrics for success. Whether your goal is to develop your skills, solve a specific challenge, find a future collaborator, or simply meet like minded people - please get on board!

We'll be hosting product development sessions and workshops from companies providing technical support, including APIs and sensor kits, as well as exploring topics such as ethics and cybersecurity.

On completion of the event you can earn a digital certificate and CPD hours.

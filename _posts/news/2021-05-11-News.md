A group of students from the 2019 cohort of the <a href="https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org">Edinburgh Centre for Robotics</a> Centre for Doctoral Training in Robotics and Autonomous Systems (CDT-RAS) have presented the outcome of their second year group project, undertaken with CARE Group.

The students developed a proof of concept entry for the <a href="https://www.eu-robotics.net/robotics_league/erl-consumer/about/index.html">European Robotics League Consumer Service competition</a>, which they explain in the video below.

A manuscript describing the project, titled "Test Framework for a Virtual Competition Testbed", has been accepted for presentation at <a href="https://www.ukras.org/news-and-events/uk-ras/">UK-RAS '21</a>.

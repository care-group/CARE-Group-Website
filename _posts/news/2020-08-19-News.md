---

An early preview of Virtual RALT, a simulation of the <a href="https://www.eu-robotics.net/robotics_league/erl-consumer/about/index.html">European Robotics League (ERL) Consumer</a> certified <a href="https://ralt.hw.ac.uk/">Robotic Assisted Living Testbed</a> is now available for <a href="https://github.com/care-group/Virtual-RALT-Standalone">download on the CARE Group GitHub</a>.

This represents the result of our initial work of creating a simulated version of the real-world testbed facility, suitable for use in a future virtual ERL Consumer Service Robot competition.

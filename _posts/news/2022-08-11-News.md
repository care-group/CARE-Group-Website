title: "EMERGENCE Co-Design Workshop"
---

The CARE group successfully run two co-design workshops to contribute to the activities of the [EMERGENCE network](https://www.emergencerobotics.net/).

Eight older adults and five healthcare experts with expertise on self-management/prevention came together with roboticists and designers from the EMERGENCE network
to explore how robotic technology may be used to provide better support to people living with frailty.

The workshops were hosted at the [University of Edinburgh](https://ed.ac.uk) with the support of the [Advanced Care Research Centre](https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/advanced-care-research-centre).

The first workshop, held on the 4th of July, focused on discovering the experiences and aspirations of people with lived experience of frailty, their carers and healthcare professionals with a focus on NHS England's Practical Guide to Healthy Ageing.

The group reconvened on the 15th of July, to work together to identify and evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of potential health technology solutions which address the issues identified in the first workshop.

---

CARE Groupâ€™s research showcased at the [Technologies for Brain Health and Dementia Prevention Workshop](https://www.sdrc.scot/technologies-innovation-workshop).

The Scottish Dementia Research Consortium (SDRC) and the Digital Health &amp; Care Innovation Centre (DHI) hosted a two-day event that encapsulated keynote speakers and interactive workshop sessions, which focused on technologies for brain health and dementia prevention

The workshop allowed communication and ideas exchange among people from different disciplines, perspectives and career stages.

Dr. Dragone provided an overview of ongoing initiatives involving our group, including our efforts to create an open and remote access living lab for AAL, targeting the fast co-creation of socially acceptable, scalable and affordable solutions to support the care of vulnerable people. He presented the experience and the result of our Robotic + Care Mashup, which we run in May 2021, and discussed how the project has set an example for how innovators, academia and the care sector can be pulled together to co-produce AAL concepts.

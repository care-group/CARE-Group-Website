title: "First Remote Access Assisted Living Lab Seeks Collaborators"
---

CARE Group academic Dr. Mauro Dragone is leading the <a href="https://ralt.hw.ac.uk/openaal.html">Open Ambient Assisted Living (OpenAAL) project</a>, which has been featured in several media outlets today. The OpenAAL project is seeking collaborators from the care sector to join the project.

Dr Mauro Dragone, assistant professor, said: “Our priority is to ensure the devised solutions are practical and feasible, so they can be quickly implemented in the face of challenging social and economic conditions. There is huge potential to unify efforts and provide better support to the nation’s most vulnerable at this time. By combining the University’s unique laboratories with expertise in the care sector, we have the opportunity to tackle the current challenges head-on, but also establish long-term and cost-effective solutions to the wider challenges faced by individuals with assisted living needs in the home.

“Successful innovation in this field is crucial to alleviate the strain on our health and social care services and enhance the resilience of our communities. By collaborating across sectors and mobilising Scotland’s ground-breaking technology, this project has the potential to bridge considerable gaps in communication, break down institutional silos and facilitate wide-scale industry cooperation.”

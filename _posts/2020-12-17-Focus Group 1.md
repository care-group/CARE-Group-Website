title: Call for Participants - Focus Group on Digital & Robotic Technology with Care and Support Providers
---

We are holding an online focus group (Zoom) on Thursday 17 December, between 10:00 and 11:00 AM GMT, with Care and Support Providers in Scotland.

The aim of the focus group is to explore urgent areas where digital solutions, including emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, voice assistants, home automation, and social robots, could help with the provision of quality, integrated and personalised care and support.

Part of the National Robotarium, a world-leading centre for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence based at Heriot-Watt University, the researchers involved in the Open Ambient Assisted Living (OpenAAL) project are creating innovative solutions to global challenges. These include technologies to enable non-intrusive monitoring of behaviour and vital signs, detect patterns and trends in behaviour and individual health status, identify problems, support self-management, decision-making and risk assessment, triage issues, facilitate communication and social connectedness, and provide social, cognitive and physical assistance when needed.

The project is holding meetings with user groups, and the Coalition of Care Providers Scotland is supporting the project and linking the research to CCPS members.

In particular, with this focus group we want to know what care and support providers across Scotland would like to see being achieved by our research, in both the short and long-term, and how we can work together, to make sure that the focus of the technology remains on improved outcomes for supported people.

To help us shape the online event, it would be great if you could already provide some information by participating to <a href="https://www.well-sorted.org/study/submitItems.php?id=FocusGroupOpenaALCSP">this well-sorted survey</a>. The survey asks you to list three key areas where you think digital and robotic technology could help your organisation. It should take five minutes of your time.

title: "Edinburgh Innovations Enterprise Initiative Grant for Robobrico"
---

Edinburgh Innovations has awarded one of their Enterprise Initiative Grants for the development of the RoboBrico service robot, a project started by Edinburgh Centre for Robotics students Alexandre Colle, Ronnie Smith, and Scott MacLeod in their spare time. The robot looks to fill a gap in the health and social care assistive technology market, by providing an affordable and highly customisable platform catered to customer needs through co-design. The robot will also be used by Alexandre Colle in the coming year in control studies exploring the role of customisation and modularity in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).

Alex, Ronnie, and Scott are members of CARE Group.

I"V<p>Academic teams from across the continent battled it out in the <a href="http://www.eu-robotics.net/robotics_league/">European Robotics League Service Robot Challenge (ERL)</a>, testing robots which aim to assist older people in a care setting.</p>

<p>The competition took place in the University’s custom built 60 square metre real life living laboratory, with researchers testing robots which could revolutionise the healthcare and social care sectors.</p>

<p>For a number of months, researchers from Heriot-Watt have been building robots with the ability to help people with age-related impairments or disabilities in their daily lives.</p>

<p>Tasks such as welcoming visitors to the home, turning the oven off and fetching reading glasses have been very well received by the robotics world and healthcare sector.</p>

<p>And this week, EU-based universities came together to compete and evaluate the performance of the robots in a home setting, to further enhance the important research.</p>

<p>Dr Mauro Dragone, Assistant Professor Assistant Professor at the School of Engineering and Physical Sciences said: “Robotic competitions such as the ERL offer a unique opportunity to break down real-work challenges into a competition similar to the UEFA Champions League.</p>

<p>“This is exciting for robotics scientists, the industry and the general public alike.</p>

<p>“This tournament is the ideal way to compare and evaluate the performance of different robotic systems of service robots.</p>

<p>“Robots are set to revolutionise our economy and society over the next 20 years as they start to work for us and beside us, assisting us and interacting with us.”</p>

<p>
Through elegant design and inspiration from home decor, the Maah, exists to encourage social interaction. Similar to a pet, the Maah will respond and communicate through body language and sound expression. Its fully articulated body is made of lightweight 3D printed material, and its skin made using 3D knitting invite customisation.

This project is part of Alexandre Colle PhD research and a tool to understand Human Robot Interaction mechanisms, the role of customisation in long term acceptance and the importance of aesthetics in social robotics. Furthermore, the use of alternative technology represents an enquiry in the way we conceive companion robots.

OXLABS Ltd. is developing habitaHub, a home wellbeing monitoring service to support greater independence for those with assisted living needs. The CARE Group is collaborating with the start-up using know-how, tools and facilities in our National Robotarium’s <a href="http://openaal.com">Open Ambient Assisted Living (OpenAAL) Laboratory </a>. The research is helping OXLABS to refine its prototype and conduct initial development of machine intelligence algorithms that can be used to track health progression and deterioration in OXLABS’ customers, acting as a springboard to the launch of its operations in Scotland

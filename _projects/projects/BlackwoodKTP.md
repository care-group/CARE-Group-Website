<!-- ## About -->

<p>
This Innovate UK Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) project is a collaboration between the CARE group and <a href="https://www.blackwoodgroup.org.uk/">Blackwood Homes and Care></a>, a Housing Association and care provider with over 100 developments across mainland Scotland. It was founded in 1972 by Dr Margaret Blackwood MBE, a campaigner for the rights and independence of disabled people.

<p>
Blackwood is  leading the way in technical innovation  within the care sector  through the application of their CleverCogs telecare digital ecosystem. The CARE Group at the National Robotarium and Blackwood’s Innovation Team are working together to enable innovative tele-care, tele-health and social robot applications, by fully integrating a mobile and interactive robot with Blackwood’s digital ecosystem, and by applying the latest thinking in robotic navigation, Human-computer Interaction (HCI) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) along with co-design concepts of usability and acceptability.

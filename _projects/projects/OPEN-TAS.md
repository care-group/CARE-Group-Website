<p>
Responsible research and innovation requires engaging openly with the wider public about research plans and activities in TAS.
</p>

<p>
Engagement also has educational value, helping learners to understand jobs and research opportunities and the skills and knowledge they require.
</p>

<p>
This project will create infrastructure for access via web/VR interfaces and telepresence robots to UK laboratories researching TAS. Beginning with a seed group of universities, companies and NGOs, the project will run a pilot with 4 leading laboratories to create an engagement experience that is educational, scalable and meets social-distancing requirements due to Covid-19.

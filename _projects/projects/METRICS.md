<p>
METRICS (Metrological Evaluation and Testing of Robots in International CompetitionS) organises challenge-led and industry-relevant competitions in the four Priority Areas (PAs) identified by ICT-09-2019-2020: Healthcare, Infrastructure Inspection and Maintenance (I&M), Agri-Food, and Agile Production.
</p>

<p>
Within METRICS, Heriot-Watt will engage with stakeholders in co-design activities to contribute to identifying tests and performance for the healthcare competition, offering its testbed for teams to test their equipment in advance of the official competition, and collect and curate data to support cascade evaluation campaigns.

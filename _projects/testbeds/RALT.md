<p>
Situated in the Lyell Centre, at Heriot-Watt Universityâ€™s Edinburgh campus, the testbed is a 60 square meters simulated apartment adjacent to a 60 square meters workshop. The simulated apartment is a fully sensorised space designed to resemble a typical single level home comprising an open-plan living, dining and kitchen area and a bathroom and bedroom, and hosting a number of smart home, assistive technologies and domestic robots. The space is equipped with a motion capturing system, a network of CCTV cameras, an RFID floor, and a device-free wireless sensing (DFWS) system for indoor localization and unobtrusive monitoring of activities of daily living. Since 2017 the lab has been used by the CARE group to train around 40 undergraduate students, 100 Msc/MEng students and 11 PhD students in topics including Smart Home, Smart Sensing, IoT and Robotics technology for health and social care applications.

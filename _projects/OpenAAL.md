## About

<p>
The Open Ambient Assisted Living (OpenAAL) project targets the fast co-creation of scalable and affordable solutions to support the care of vulnerable people whose urgent need has been exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic.      
</p>
<p>
The project (running from July 2020 to April 2021) is funded by EPSRC under the Impact Acceleration Accounts schema. These are strategic awards provided to institutions to support knowledge exchange (KE) and impact from their funded research.

Part of the <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/research/the-national-robotarium.htm">National Robotarium</a>, based at Heriot-Watt University, the OpenAAL lab will use digital twin, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud technologies to provide a platform where researchers, industry and care providers alongside end users of assisted living services can co-create technology, where time and distance is no longer a barrier â€“ any time, any place access.

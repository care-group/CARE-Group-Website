## About

<p>
We look after the IoT instrumentation of our <a href="https://care.hw.ac.uk/img/testbeds.html">testbeds</a>. We are expert in smart home software, voice assistants, home automation and related standards.  
</p>

<p>
We can test a wide range of products being considered in home settings and care contexts in aspects including performance, effectiveness, privacy and cybsersecurity. This includes wearables, smart home appliances, or other connected devices, such as home activity monitoring products used to track health and wellbeing in the home.
</p>

<p>
We collaborate with care providers and end-users to explore the opportunities presented by the use of these technologies as part of their daily lives and care practices. We also collaborate with assistive technology companies, to inform the next generation of home activity monitoring and other assistive living products. 
</p>

<p>
We have developed software to capture complex, interleaved and hierarchical naturalistic activities of daily living (ADL), collected in very rich sensor environments, and machine learning methods for the automatic annotation of the data.  These tools can be used to create and validate data collection and signal processing pipelines, machine learning solutions for interpreting sensed data into activities of daily living and data analytics and data visualisation tools for the analysis of health and wellness data.

<p>
Get in touch if you want more information about any of our existing datasets or if you are a company of assistive products or a care provider requiring our expertise in IoT, machine learning and home activity monitoring technology.

<p>
The CARE group hosts international competitions in consumer and healthcare robotics. These competitions aim to bolster research in service robotics for home applications, and to raise public awareness of the current and future capabilities of such robot systems to meet societal challenges like healthy ageing and longer independent living.  
</p>

<p>
The robots are evaluated on functionalities such as object detection, activity recognition, object handover, task-oriented grasping and speech understanding, which are required to complete tasks such as assessing the activity state of a person, delivery items such as medicines to a person and preparing and transporting a drink.

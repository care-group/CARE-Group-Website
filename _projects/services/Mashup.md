<p>
Our Robotics + Care Mashup brings together academics, care providers and technologists to develop solutions for assisted living. Participants get immersed in a real product development process over the course of a week, with delegates from all around the country. Together they explore the use of emerging technology including cloud, robotics and the Internet of Things equipped with machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Participants own everything they develop and set their own metrics for success.

<p>
Mashup events include product development sessions and workshops from companies providing technical support, including APIs and sensor kits, and talks from international experts discussing topics such as ethics and cybersecurity for robotic assistive systems.

<p>Read more information in our <a href="https://care.hw.ac.uk/downloads/OpenAAL_FAQs.pdf">Q&A document</a> and register to our community hub on <a href="https://vi.to/hubs/robotics-care-mashup">Vi.to</a> to learn about our first Robotic + Care Mashup, which we run in May 2021. 
The event gathered around 140 attendees (20% from SMEs & AT companies, 60% from academy, 20% from healthcare organisations).
You will be able to access the recording of 14 talks from international experts (on topics such as IoT, Ethics, Cybersecurity, Social Robotics, AAL), 3 co-design sessions (chaired by DHI) and mentoring sessions (from DHI, InnoScot and University of Edinburgh’s Design Informatics), and also browse posts and content to learn about technology providers and ethics, design thinking, and accessibity guidelines for online meetings, robotics and assistive techology.

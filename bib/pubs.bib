	abstract = {While Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems may benefit from Active Learning (AL) by allowing users to self-annotate their Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), many proposed methods for collecting such annotations are for short-term data collection campaigns for specific datasets. We present a reusable dialogue-based approach to user interaction for active learning in HAR systems, which utilises a dataset of natural language descriptions of common activities (which we make publicly available) and semantic similarity measures. Our approach involves system-initiated dialogue, including follow-up questions to reduce ambiguity in user responses where appropriate. We apply our work to an existing CASAS dataset in an active learning scenario, to demonstrate our work in context, in which a natural language interface provides knowledge that can help interpret other multi-modal sensor data. We provide results highlighting the potential of our dialogue- and semantic similarity-based approach. We evaluate our work: (i) technically, as an effective way to seek users’ input for active learning of ADLs; and (ii) qualitatively, through a user study in which users were asked to use our approach and an established method, and to subsequently compare the two. Results show the potential of our approach as a user-friendly mechanism for annotation of sensor data as part of an active learning system.},

	abstract = {Robotics and automation have the potential to signiﬁcantly improve quality of life for people with assistive needs and their carers. Adoption of such technologies at this point in time is far from widespread. This paper presents a novel approach to the design of highly customisable robotic concepts, embracing modularity and a co-design process to increase the involvement of end-users in the development life cycle. We discuss this process within the context of an elderly care use case. Using design methodology and additive manufacturing, we outline how key stakeholders can be involved from initial conception through to integration of the ﬁnal product within their environments. In future work, we will apply this process to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for improving long-term acceptance and trust of robotic technology in care contexts.},
